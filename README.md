## Getting Started
# What is the use of the keyof keyword in TypeScript? Provide an example.
When a variable can have multiple types, then we use the "union" symbol to take one of the values. Instead of union, we can use "keyof"

# Explain the difference between any, unknown, and never types in TypeScript.
type "any" means it can be any type. With the use of any, we lose type advantage. Its use is not recommended
type "unknown" means now it not known but it will be know on oparation. sometime it can use.
type "never" when no provability to return a value this is never type.
